    The first step in understanding how to position elements is to understand the:
    <h3>The Box Model</h3> 
    <p>
    Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the boundaries 
    and the borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. A div element creates
    a box, as do h1,img,span, and td elements. Each box has properties you can set with CSS.
    I have  illustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Figure 1 Border;padding and margin </h4>
<p> 
    The <i>padding </i>of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box 
    border, and themargin is the distance between a box and any adjacent element. In other
    words, padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside the border.
    In the following CSS, I set both the padding and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. 
    This is why you can see so much white space in Figure 1. 
    <br>
    The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can 
    change the color of an elements border,as well as the thickness and line style the browser uses 
    when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the result of a style rule telling the 
    browser to draw a solid, thin, red line around the box that each div element creates.
