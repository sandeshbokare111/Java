            The first step in understanding how to position elements is to understand the:
            <h3>The Box Model</h3> 
            <p>Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the boundaries and the borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. A div element creates a box, as do h1,img,span, and td elements. Each box has properties you can set with CSS. I have  illustrated some of these properties in Figure 1.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>Figure 1 Border;padding and margin </h4>
        <p> 
            The <i>padding </i>of a box is the distance between the content of the box and the box border, and themargin is the distance between a box and any adjacent element. In other words, padding adds space inside the border, while a margin adds space outside the border. In the following CSS, I set both the padding and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white space in Figure 1. <br>The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS I can change the color of an elements border, as well as the thickness and line style the browser uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the result of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line around the box that each div element creates.
