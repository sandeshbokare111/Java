What is Hibernate?
What is ORM?
What Challanges we have to face in JDBC API based application.
Answer: 
     At the time of creation:
	1. Mapping data members to column (number of data members with columns in table)
	2. Mapping Relationship (parent child, primary key foreign key)
	3. Handling Data types (May face type mismatch)
	4. Mapping changes to object state (IF do changes in Object then also need to map
	means change type of any member or add additional member)
     Challenges At the time of saving data in database using JDBC:
	1. JDBC configuration
		1. 5 Steps of configuration.
		2. Exception Handling.
		3. Object Model
			Need to save data seperately, using methods in service.
		4. DAO, use to save your object in database, but for this we have to use SQL
		   queries. They are Database specific.
		5. Caching is not available in JDBC. (Swipe ID card for Database entry)
		6. Transaction -- Rollback example, can be done explicitly

What are Benefits of Hibernate?
Answer: 
	1. All drawbacks of JDBC API can be overcome in Hibernate.
	2. Hibernate supports auto data definition language (ddl) which supports (create, alter, truncate, drop)
	3. You need to provide only hibernate mapping means database details.
	4. No need to create table
	5. Hibernate supports ORM. Means saves object into table.
	6. Primary and foreign keys relationship can be easily managed by Hibernate.
	7. Support HQL. Hibernate query language.
	8. Exception handling

First Demo for Hibernate:
Step 1. Create a database in MSSQL
Step 2. Open Eclipse and Create new Project
Step 3. Add All Jar in project
Step 4. Add mapping and congig file.
